Unit Testing Suite
=====================

This module serves as the root for the unit testing suite of the unit conversion application.
It organizes tests into specific submodules aligning with the MVC architecture:
models, views, and controllers.

The structured approach facilitates targeted and comprehensive testing
of each aspect of the application, supporting the project's commitment
to Test-Driven Development (TDD) and software engineering practices.

Submodules
----------
- Models: Tests focused on data logic and integrity.
- Views: Tests for the user interface components, including CLI and GUI.
- Controllers: Tests verifying the application's operational logic and flow.

Note:
-----
This module is currently under development.
